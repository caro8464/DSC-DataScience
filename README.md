# DSC-DataScience
Every challenge gets it's own branch. 
Branches should be named after their designation `A3. Phyton Excercise` => `A3`
this way it's easy to differentiate multiple codebases

## Kaggle: 15 YEARS OF POWER OUTAGES
+ errors:
  * empty values
  * a few different indicators of missing data  

+ clean data with python/pandas:
  1. change all missing data indicators so you only have one type left
  2. drop all lines with missing data in all columns
  3. drop all lines with missing data in all date columns
  4. set year where missing and one of the other dates are set
